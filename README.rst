Gapy is a thin service account client for Google Analytics. 

Get set up
----------

First you need to create a service account in your [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console).
Then just create a gapy client and start querying. Ids, metrics and dimensions are provided without the `ga:` prefix.
They can be provided as lists or single values.::

    import gapy

    client = gapy.service_account("your account name",
                private_key="your private key",
                storage_path="path/to/storage.db")
    reach_data = client.query.get("12345",
                datetime(2012, 1, 1),
                datetime(2012, 2, 2),
                ["visits", "visitors"],
                "date")
